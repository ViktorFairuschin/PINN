# Physics Informed Neural Network

This is a TensorFlow implementation of physics informed neural 
network for one-dimensional wave equation.

## A brief introduction to physics informed neural networks



Consider a one-dimensional wave equation 

![equation](equations/light_mode/1.svg)

with two initial conditions

![equation](equations/light_mode/2.svg)

and two boundary conditions

![equation](equations/light_mode/3.svg)

The idea of physics informed neural networks (PINN) is to approximate u(x,t)
neural network (universal functions approximation)
